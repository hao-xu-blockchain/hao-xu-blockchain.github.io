Modern Coding Theory
======
- 2024 Spring
- Tongji University
This course is a one semester postgraduate school course given once every year. We are concerned exclusively with iterative coding systems and convolution coding theory. If you are interested in classical algebraic coding and verterbi algorithms we highly recommend the course by Assist. Prof. Hao Xu.
